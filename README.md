<img src="github-banner.jpg" alt="programmer cartoon" />

I've always loved programming, especially web-oriented programming, and I've always been researching and learning on my own. That is why I decided to start my career as Full Stack Dev at SoyHenry, to gather and consolidate my knowledge and thus be able to work on what I like the most.
I am extremely responsible and committed to my tasks, always with a good predisposition and constantly learning. I am also a student of Information Systems Engineering, where I have acquired a very powerful logical reasoning.
